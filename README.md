# Classic-To-Do-List
This is a classic to-do list web app to help with our daily progress .<br/>
You can change the backround looks either by choosing a pastel color or a classic image that suits you .<br/>
I used in this project a little bit of HTML5, CSS3 , pure Javascript , OOP , and the ability to save changes at local storage . <br/>
The main challenge in this project was how you can change between color or image background and keep your choise at local storage .
